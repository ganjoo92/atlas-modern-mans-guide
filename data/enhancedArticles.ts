### The Power of First Impressions

Research shows that people form judgments about you within the first 7 seconds of meeting. This isn't superficial—it's hardwired into our psychology for survival. The good news? You can master this process.

[TAKEAWAY] First impressions matter | People decide if they like, trust, and want to work with you in just 7 seconds | Social Psychology

**R - Remember Names**
Use their name 2-3 times in conversation. It's the sweetest sound to any person.

**K - Keep It Genuine**
Authenticity beats perfection every time. People can sense when you're being real.

### The Science Behind Connection

[QUIZ] What percentage of communication is non-verbal? | 55% | 38% | 7% | 93% | 0 | Body language and tone carry most of our message

This means your presence speaks louder than your words.

[REFLECTION] What's one area of first impressions you want to improve most?

**Key Insight**: Confidence isn't about being perfect; it's about being comfortable with who you are while continuously growing.

### Your Action Plan

### Why Confidence Isn't What You Think

Most men believe confidence comes from external achievements—money, success, recognition. This is confidence's biggest lie. True confidence is an inside job, and it can be built systematically.

[TAKEAWAY] Confidence is a skill | Like any skill, confidence can be developed through deliberate practice and repetition | Psychology

### The Confidence Equation

**Confidence = Competence + Self-Acceptance + Action**

Let's break this down:

#### Competence (30%)
Skills you can demonstrate and rely on.

[ACTION] List 5 skills you're genuinely good at (no matter how small)

#### Self-Acceptance (40%)
Comfort with your flaws and appreciation of your strengths.

[REFLECTION] What's one "flaw" of yours that you could reframe as a strength?

#### Action (30%)
The willingness to move forward despite fear or uncertainty.

[ACTION] Do one thing today that slightly scares you

### Week 1: Foundation Building

[CHECKLIST] Week 1 Habits | Morning power pose (2 minutes) | Write down 3 wins from the day | Maintain eye contact in conversations | Speak 20% slower | Take up space when sitting

**The Power Pose Protocol**
Stand like a superhero for 2 minutes each morning. Research by Amy Cuddy shows this increases testosterone by 20% and decreases cortisol by 25%.

[QUIZ] How long does it take for a power pose to change your hormone levels? | 30 seconds | 2 minutes | 5 minutes | 10 minutes | 1 | Your body chemistry starts changing in just 2 minutes

### Week 2: Voice and Presence

Your voice carries 38% of your communication impact. This week, we optimize it.

[CHECKLIST] Voice Development | Practice diaphragmatic breathing | Record yourself speaking for 1 minute daily | Slow down your speech rate | End statements without uptalk | Use pauses for emphasis

**The Breath-Voice Connection**
Confident people breathe from their diaphragm, not their chest. This creates a deeper, more resonant voice that commands attention.

[ACTION] Place one hand on chest, one on belly. Practice breathing so only the bottom hand moves

### The Confidence Spiral

Confidence works in spirals—both up and down. Each confident action creates evidence for your brain that you're capable, which makes the next confident action easier.

[REFLECTION] Think of a time when you felt truly confident. What evidence did you have that supported that feeling?

### Dealing with Setbacks

Everyone has confidence dips. The difference is how quickly you bounce back.

**The Bounce-Back Protocol:**
1. Acknowledge the feeling without judgment
2. Review your evidence (past wins and growth)
3. Take one small confident action
4. Remember: feelings aren't facts

[ACTION] Create a "confidence collection"—a note on your phone with your wins, compliments received, and growth moments

### Your 30-Day Confidence Scorecard

Track your progress daily:
- Morning power pose: ✓/✗
- One confident action: ✓/✗
- Evening wins review: ✓/✗

[TAKEAWAY] Progress over perfection | You don't need to be perfect—you just need to be 1% better each day | Growth Mindset

### Beyond 30 Days

Confidence isn't a destination—it's a practice. These habits should become your new normal, not a temporary experiment.

[REFLECTION] Which of these habits has had the biggest impact on how you feel about yourself?

The man you are today took years to become. The confident man you're becoming will emerge through consistent, intentional action. Trust the process.
